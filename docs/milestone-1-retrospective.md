Observation: The control flow lacked user feedback and quick precision adjustment.

Change: Introduced Auto Set for immediate target assignment and Command Window for system feedback.

Impact: Improved clarity, reduced UI ambiguity, and aligned with smart-device conventions (feedback loop between user and system).

Next step: Test responsiveness of updates and expand the feedback window for status transitions (e.g., “Reaching target,” “Stable”).
